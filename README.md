# Steps 2 : Document Preparation and Embedding Pipeline

## Detailed Steps 

### 1. Text Extraction

- **Supported formats:**  
  - PDF (scanned or native)  
  - Images (jpeg, png, etc.)  
  - Word documents (.docx)

- **Methods used:**  
  - Native PDFs: direct text extraction (if possible)  
  - Scanned PDFs & images: convert to images + OCR using `pytesseract`  
  - Word documents: reading via the `python-docx` library

### 2. Chunking (segmenting)

- Limit the text size to match embedding and LLM model capacities.  
- Typical method: chunk by max number of tokens (~500 tokens per chunk).

### 3. Embedding Generation

- **Model used:** `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`

- **Installation:**
```bash
pip install sentence-transformers
````
- **Example of generation:**
```bash
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
```

### 4. Storage in PostgreSQL with pgvector
- **PostgreSQL + pgvector extension installation:**
````bash
#Dans psql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;

````
- **SQL table:**
````bash
CREATE TABLE document_chunks (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    file_name VARCHAR,
    chunk_index INTEGER,
    text_chunk TEXT,
    embedding VECTOR(384),
    metadata JSONB
);
`````
- **SQLAlchemy model:**
    - SQLAlchemy is an ORM (**Object Relational Mapper**) in Python that allows you to manipulate a relational database using Python classes.
A **SQLAlchemy** model corresponds to a Python class linked to a SQL table.
     
## Useful Commands
- **Install dependencies:**
  
  ````bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt`
  ````
- **Create pgvector extension in PostgreSQL (psql):**
   ````bash
   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
   ````
- **Create the table:**
  ````bash 
   CREATE TABLE document_chunks (
     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     file_name VARCHAR,
     chunk_index INTEGER,
     text_chunk TEXT,
     embedding VECTOR(384),
    doc_metadata JSONB  
    );
    ````
- **Environment Configuration**:
  
  Create a **.env** file:
  ````bash
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_NAME=postgres
   DB_USER=postgres
   DB_PASSWORD=root
  ````
- **Run Flask microservice:**
   ````
    python app.py
   ````
- **Run the test script:**
  ```` 
  python test_post_upload.py
  ````
# Steps 3: Query Processing and Semantic Search
## FastAPI-based Semantic Search API
- 1. Accepts user question (natural language)
- 2. Embeds it with the same transformer model
- 3. Performs vector similarity search using pgvector

- 4. Returns top-k (default: 5) matching chunks for LLM prompt building

### Commands
- **Run FastAPI for querying:**
````bash
  uvicorn main:app --reload
````
- **Sample Query via cURL**
  ````bash 
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/semantic-search \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"question": "What is the policy for paid leave?",
  "top_k": 3}'
  ````
  - **Response:**
   ````bash 
    [
      {
        "file_name":"Leave-Policy-Template-for-Human-Resources.pdf",
         "chunk_index":0,
         "text_chunk":"LEAVE POLICY\nTEMPLATE FOR\nHR\nPROFESSIONALS\nn= 7\nBy\nHRGURUJI\nwww....taking of such leave.\nPolicy provisions apply to all employees, that is, permanent employees, temporary employees and\ncasual employees.",
        "doc_metadata":null,
        "similarity_score":1.5923
      }
    ]
    ````

 # Step 4: Prompting + Answer Generation with Together.ai

- Sign up at https://together.ai
- Go to your account settings

- Get your API Key (free tier gives you limited usage).

- Install HTTP client library if needed
````bash 
pip install requests
````
- **Run FastAPI for querying:**
````bash
  uvicorn main:app --reload
````
- **Sample Query via cURL**
````bash 
     POST http://localhost:8000/semantic-search \
     "Content-Type: application/json" \
     '{"question": "What is the policy for paid leave?",
  "top_k": 2}'
````
-   **Response:**
   ````bash 
step 4
{"answer":"Employees who are away from the office and who are being treated in an institution for the rehabilitation of alcoholism, or drug addiction may be granted sick leave for the period that they are away, provided that a sufficient number of days sick leave are available to the employee.","context":                                      [
  [

    "chunk_index":23,
    "text_chunk":"(6) Should an employee become ill whilst on annual leave, such portion of their vacation leave\nmay, ....",
    "doc_metadata":null,"similarity_score":1.696},
    
   {"file_name":"Leave-Policy-Template-for-Human-Resources.pdf","chunk_index":23,
   "text_chunk":"(6) Should an employee become ill whilst on annual leave, such portion of their vacation leave\nmay, subject to the submissio ...leave are available to the","doc_metadata":{"file_type":"application/pdf","file_size":374786},"similarity_score":1.696}
   ]
  } 
````

# Step 5: Unified FastAPI Endpoint /ask
- Full Endpoint Code :
````bash 
  @app.post("/ask")
def ask(query: QueryInput):
    chunks = search_similar_chunks(query.question, query.top_k)
    context = "\n---\n".join(chunk["text_chunk"] for chunk in chunks)
    prompt = f"Context:\n{context}\n\nQuestion: {query.question}\nAnswer:"
    answer = ask_llm(prompt)
    return {"answer": answer, "context": chunks}
````
- ### Test Scripts Summary

| Script             | Purpose                                      |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `test_post_upload.py` | Upload documents, extract text, embed content, and insert into PostgreSQL |
| `main.py` (FastAPI)   | Answer user questions via the `/ask` route (RAG pipeline entry point) |
| `together_llm.py`       | Handles API call to Together.ai for open-source LLM (e.g., Mistral) |
| `search_logic.py`     | Performs semantic similarity search in PostgreSQL using `pgvector` |

##  Run Order â€” How to Test the Full RAG System

Follow these steps to test the system end-to-end:

---

###  1. Start PostgreSQL and Enable `pgvector`

Ensure your PostgreSQL server is running and the `pgvector` extension is enabled:

```sql
-- Inside psql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
````
### 2. Launch the Flask Document Ingestion Microservice

Run your Flask service to enable document upload and processing:

```bash
python app_flask.py
````
This will start the document ingestion microservice, which:

- Accepts file uploads (PDF, DOCX, images)

- Extracts text (with OCR if needed)

- Splits into chunks

- Embeds text with MiniLM

- Stores in PostgreSQL with pgvector
### 3. Run the Test Uploader
This script sends multiple HR documents to the ingestion endpoint for processing:

````bash
python test_post_upload.py
````
It performs:

- Upload of .docx, .pdf, and .png files from a folder like hr_documents/

- Text extraction + embedding

- Insertion into document_chunks table in PostgreSQL
### 4. Launch FastAPI for Querying

Start your FastAPI server to handle semantic search and question-answering:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
````
This will launch the API server at:
````bash
http://127.0.0.1:8000
````
Once started, the /ask endpoint will be available for queries.
### 5. Ask Questions via Postman 

- **Sample Query via cURL**
````bash 
     POST http://localhost:8000/ask
     "Content-Type: application/json" \
     {"question": "What is the maternity   leave policy?",
      "top_k": 5
}

````
-   **Response:**
````bash

## Step 6: Implementation of Multi-turn Dialogue Memory in the RAG System

### 1. Objective
Allow Purpella to handle follow-up questions by keeping track of the last 3 Q&A turns **per user session**. This makes conversations more natural and context-aware.


### 2. Database Schema for Memory
```sql
CREATE TABLE conversation_memory (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    session_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    turn_number INTEGER NOT NULL,
    question TEXT NOT NULL,
    answer TEXT NOT NULL,
    timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
````
### 3. FastAPI Endpoint Update /ask
- Accept session_id in request.

- Fetch last 3 Q&A pairs from conversation_memory by session_id.

- Format them into the "Conversation history" section.

- Generate prompt and call LLM.

- Save current turn into conversation_memory.
### 4. Ask Questions via Postman 

   - POST /ask
  
````bash 
     POST http://localhost:8000/ask
     "Content-Type: application/json" \
     {
       "session_id": "abc123",
        "question": "What is the annual   leave policy?",
       "top_k": 3
}
